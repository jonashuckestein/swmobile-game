    <h2>Walking is boring.  Walk and Play instead.</h2>
    
    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <p>It's simple:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in and enter your destination.</li>
      <li>Walk forward.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You will run into an ongoing conflict and be chosen to help one side to defeat the other.  You will then be assigned a quest that you must complete on the way to your destination.</p>
    
    <h3>Abilities, Experience points</h3>
    <p>Along the way, you can pick up items, dodge enemies, or engage them as you complete your quest.  Build your abilities and gain experience points each time you're successful.</p>
    
    <h3>Safe Zones</h3>
    <p>If your health is depleted after an engagement, try to find health items or enter a safe zone, where you can get a full restoration in one minute.</p>
    <p>If you successfully complete your quest, you will gain experience points.  Accumulate enough points and you will move to the next level, which will unlock new profile pictures and quests, and increase your abilities.</p>
    <p>If you your signal gets dropped mid-game, don't worry, just restart your game.</p>
    <p>Each time you play, you will get a different quest.</p>
    
    <h3>Abilities</h3>
    <p>Strength - the power to attack or engage enemies</p>
    <p>Defense - your resistance to attacks by enemies in terms of health</p>
    <p>Range - how close you need to get to your enemies before you can start an attack</p>
    
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>The more you play, the more experience points you can accumulate.  Every 100 experience point you increase a level, up to 10 levels.  Each level unlocks new profile pictures and quests.</p>
    
    <h3>Health and Safe Zones</h3>
    <p>There are two ways to restore your health, through items you pick up or if you find and enter a safe zone.  Safe zones are designated in green on the map.  It will take one minute inside a safe zone to complete a full power up.  If you lose your health during a quest, you must power up to continue and complete your quest.</p>
